# threaded_rod_mounting_system
Threaded rod mounting system for building temporary constructions

## My own approach to building stuff from cheap, available materials. Goals:
* Easy to print - without supports or with minimal internal supports;
* Reusable modules - bulk of designes can be reasebled into different projects;
* Parametric design - different files for different rod sizes with easy development of additional elements;

## Key elements for constructions:
* XY connector - perpendicular
* XY connector - with 45 degree connection
* XY connector - with 30/60 degree connection
* XYZ connector - perpendicular
* XYZ connector - width 45 degree connection for one axis

## Connector / uses:
* Single rod for short element with small load;
* Double rod to achieve stiffness in one plane;
* Four rod connector for handling load / long elements;
