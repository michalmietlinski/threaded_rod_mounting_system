# threaded_rod_mounting_system
Available systems:
*12.4mm system - for less acurate prints and no threading of elements - smaller diameter size might result in need to screw in rod instead of just inserting element


## Diameter pros and cons:
* Exact diameter will result in need of screwing rods - making it impossible to connect some elements;
* Screwed in rods will have less wobble, thus are better for precise use;
* Screwing rods takes a lot of time and energy- making it less useful for easily disassebled constructions
